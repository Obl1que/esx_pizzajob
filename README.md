# esx_pizzajob

## Info
[Mama John's ymap](https://forum.cfx.re/t/mama-johns-pizza-place/697391)
I did not create the model.

## Setup
1. Add esx_pizzajob to your resources and add 'start esx_pizzajob' to your server.cfg
2. Edit config.lua to your ped locations etc. and find good delivery locations for the pizza place. You can also remove the spawn ped at delivery location if it isn't working well.
3. Import 'esx_pizzajob.sql' into your database.
4. Done! You can use the mod now!
